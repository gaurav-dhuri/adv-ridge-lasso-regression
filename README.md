Building an Advance Linear Regression Model with Ridge/Lasso for Housing Dataset

## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house?
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Dataset provided is train.csv

## Conclusions
### Feature which holds significance in contributing towards buying the house are as follows:
-  GrLivArea
-  OverallQual
-  MSZoning_RL
-  MSZoning_RH
-  GarageArea
-  OverallCond
-  MSZoning_FV
-  MSZoning_RM
-  1stFlrSF
-  BedroomAbvGr

## Final model prediction (Test)
   
Mean Square Error (MSE) Ridge 0.002145	
Mean Square Error (MSE) Lasso 0.002095


## Python Libraries Used
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn 
- Numpy
- Sklearn
